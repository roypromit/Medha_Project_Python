Course-End Project: Personal Expense Tracker
Problem statement:
In today’s fast-paced world, individuals need to track and manage their expenses
effectively. Your task is to build a personal expense tracker that allows users to log
daily expenses, categorize them, and track spending against a monthly budget. The
tracker should also be able to save and load expenses from a file for future
reference.
Objectives:
1. Design and implement a personal expense tracker that enables users to
manage their expenses
2. Allow users to categorize expenses and set monthly budgets
3. Implement file-handling functionality to save and load expense data
4. Create an interactive, menu-driven interface for ease of use
Steps to perform:
1. Add an expense:
• Create a function to prompt the user for expense details. Ensure you ask for:
o The date of the expense in the format YYYY-MM-DD
o The category of the expense, such as Food or Travel
o The amount spent
o A brief description of the expense
• Store the expense in a list as a dictionary, where each dictionary includes the
date, category, amount, and description as key-value pairs
Example:
{'date': '2024-09-18', 'category': 'Food', 'amount': 15.50, 'description':
'Lunch with friends'}
2. View expenses:
• Write a function to retrieve and display all stored expenses
o Ensure the function loops through the list of expenses and displays the
date, category, amount, and description for each entry
• Validate the data before displaying it
o If any required details (date, category, amount, or description) are
missing, skip the entry or notify the user that it’s incomplete
3. Set and track the budget:
• Create a function that allows the user to input a monthly budget. Prompt the
user to:
o Enter the total amount they want to budget for the month
• Create another function that calculates the total expenses recorded so far
o Compare the total with the user’s monthly budget
o If the total expenses exceed the budget, display a warning (Example:
You have exceeded your budget!)
o If the expenses are within the budget, display the remaining balance
(Example: You have 150 left for the month)
4. Save and load expenses:
• Implement a function to save all expenses to a CSV file, with each row
containing the date, category, amount, and description of each expense
• Create another function to load expenses from the CSV file. When the
program starts, it should:
o Read the saved data from the file
o Load it back into the list of expenses so the user can see their previous
expenses and continue from where they left off
5. Create an interactive menu:
• Build a function to display a menu with the following options:
o Add expense
o View expenses
o Track budget
o Save expenses
o Exit
• Allow the user to enter a number to choose an option
• Implement the following conditions:
o If the user selects option 1, call the function to add an expense
o If the user selects option 2, call the function to view expenses
o If the user selects option 3, call the function to track the budget
o If the user selects option 4, call the function to save expenses to the file
o If the user selects option 5, save the expenses and exit the program
